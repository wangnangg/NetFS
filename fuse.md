## Operations

From docs:

The file system operations:

Most of these should work very similarly to the well known UNIX file system operations.  A major exception is that instead of returning an error in `errno`, the operation should return the negated error value (`-errno`) directly.

All methods are optional, but some are essential for a useful filesystem (e.g. `getattr`).  `open`, `flush`, `release`, `fsync`, `opendir`, `releasedir`, `fsyncdir`, `access`, `create`, `truncate`, `lock`, `init` and `destroy` are special purpose methods, without which a full featured filesystem can still be implemented.

In general, all methods are expected to perform any necessary permission checking. However, a filesystem may delegate this task to the kernel by passing the `default_permissions` mount option to `fuse_new()`. In this case, methods will only be called if the kernel's permission check has succeeded.

Almost all operations take a path which can be of any length.

### Explanation from Docs

#### open

Open a file

Open flags are available in fi->flags. The following rules apply.

- Creation (O_CREAT, O_EXCL, O_NOCTTY) flags will be filtered out / handled by the kernel.
- Access modes (O_RDONLY, O_WRONLY, O_RDWR) should be used by the filesystem to check if the operation is permitted. If the `-o default_permissions` mount option is given, this check is already done by the kernel before calling [open()](http://libfuse.github.io/doxygen/structfuse__operations.html#a14b98c3f7ab97cc2ef8f9b1d9dc0709d) and may thus be omitted by the filesystem.
- When writeback caching is enabled, the kernel may send read requests even for files opened with O_WRONLY. The filesystem should be prepared to handle this.
- When writeback caching is disabled, the filesystem is expected to properly handle the O_APPEND flag and ensure that each write is appending to the end of the file.
- When writeback caching is enabled, the kernel will handle O_APPEND. However, unless all changes to the file come through the kernel this will not work reliably. The filesystem should thus either ignore the O_APPEND flag (and let the kernel handle it), or return an error (indicating that reliably O_APPEND is not available).

Filesystem may store an arbitrary file handle (pointer, index, etc) in fi->fh, and use this in other all other file operations (read, write, flush, release, fsync).

Filesystem may also implement stateless file I/O and not store anything in fi->fh.

There are also some flags (direct_io, keep_cache) which the filesystem may set in fi, to change the way the file is opened. See [fuse_file_info](http://libfuse.github.io/doxygen/structfuse__file__info.html) structure in <fuse_common.h> for more details.

If this request is answered with an error code of ENOSYS and FUSE_CAP_NO_OPEN_SUPPORT is set in `fuse_conn_info.capable`, this is treated as success and future calls to open will also succeed without being send to the filesystem process.

#### flush

Possibly flush cached data

BIG NOTE: This is not equivalent to [fsync()](http://libfuse.github.io/doxygen/structfuse__operations.html#a92bdd6f43ba390a54ac360541c56b528). It's not a request to sync dirty data.

Flush is called on each close() of a file descriptor. So if a filesystem wants to return write errors in close() and the file has cached dirty data, this is a good place to write back data and return any errors. Since many applications ignore close() errors this is not always useful.

NOTE: The [flush()](http://libfuse.github.io/doxygen/structfuse__operations.html#ad4ec9c309072a92dd82ddb20efa4ab14) method may be called more than once for each [open()](http://libfuse.github.io/doxygen/structfuse__operations.html#a14b98c3f7ab97cc2ef8f9b1d9dc0709d). This happens if more than one file descriptor refers to an opened file due to dup(), dup2() or fork() calls. It is not possible to determine if a flush is final, so each flush should be treated equally. Multiple write-flush sequences are relatively rare, so this shouldn't be a problem.

Filesystems shouldn't assume that flush will always be called after some writes, or that if will be called at all.
